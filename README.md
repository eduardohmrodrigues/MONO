#**MONO**

## Synopsis

This project was written in C# using the [Unity Engine](unity3d.com) to a hackaton competition. It is a puzzle/platform game where the player changes the world colors between black and white to solve the puzzles and advance in the history.

## Motivation

This project was started in a game jam competition in June 2016, since then the game have a very positive feedback both in the mechanical and in the minimalist design that was one of the most prominent characteristics of this game. Since then the MONO has been presented in events like [SuperCon](www.superconvencao.com.br) even knowing that it still in a early stage of development.

## Installation

You only need to install the [Unity Engine](unity3d.com) and open the project.
